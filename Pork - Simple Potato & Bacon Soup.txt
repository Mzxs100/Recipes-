Simple Potato & Bacon Soup
This version focuses purely on the core ingredients, resulting in a rich and straightforward soup that highlights the delicious flavors of potato and bacon.
Yields: 6-8 servings Prep time: 10 minutes Cook time: 30-40 minutes
Ingredients
* 6-8 slices of bacon, chopped
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon onion powder (optional, for flavor)
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (optional, for flavor)
* 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
* 2 cups milk or heavy cream (or a combination)
* 2 pounds of potatoes, peeled and diced (about 5-6 medium potatoes)
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
* Garnishes: shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream
Instructions
1. Crisp the Bacon: In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook the chopped bacon over medium heat until crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove the bacon and set it aside on a paper towel-lined plate. Leave about 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat in the pot.
2. Create the Roux: With the pot still on medium heat, whisk the all-purpose flour into the reserved bacon fat. If you're using them, add the onion powder and garlic powder now. Cook this mixture (the roux), whisking constantly, for about one minute.
3. Simmer the Soup: Gradually pour in the chicken or vegetable broth while whisking continuously to ensure the roux dissolves smoothly without lumps. Add the diced potatoes and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are very tender.
4. Achieve Desired Consistency:
   * For a creamy soup: Use an immersion blender to blend the soup directly in the pot until it reaches your desired smoothness.
   * For a chunkier soup: Use a potato masher to carefully break down some of the potatoes, leaving some chunks for texture.
5. Add the Dairy and Seasoning: Stir in the milk or cream. Warm the soup through gently over low heat, but do not let it boil. Season generously with salt and pepper to your taste.
6. Serve and Garnish: Ladle the soup into bowls. Top with the reserved crispy bacon, a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese, and a dollop of sour cream.
