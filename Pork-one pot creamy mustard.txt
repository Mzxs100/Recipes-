One-Pot Creamy Mustard Pork Pasta
This recipe is designed to be made entirely in your 3qt saucier, creating a flavorful, creamy meal with minimal cleanup. The pasta cooks directly in the savory mustard sauce, releasing starches that give it a wonderful consistency. The optional addition of gelatin is a simple chef's trick that elevates the sauce to a truly silky, restaurant-quality texture.
Yields: 2-3 servings
Prep time: 15 minutes
Cook time: 20-25 minutes
Ingredients
 * ¾ lb Pork Loin or Tenderloin, cut into bite-sized (½ to ¾-inch) pieces
 * 1 tbsp Butter
 * 1 large Shallot, finely minced (or ½ a small yellow onion)
 * 2 cloves Garlic, minced
 * ¼ cup Dry White Wine (e.g., Sauvignon Blanc) or an equal amount of extra vegetable broth
 * 2 ½ cups Vegetable Broth, divided
 * ½ cup Heavy Cream
 * 2 tbsp Dijon Mustard
 * 1 tbsp Whole Grain Mustard (optional, for texture)
 * 8 oz Short Pasta (such as penne, shells, or fusilli)
 * 1 tsp Fresh Thyme leaves (or ½ tsp dried thyme)
 * 2 handfuls Fresh Spinach or 1 cup Frozen Peas (optional)
 * Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper, to taste
 * Fresh Parsley, chopped, for garnish
Optional Ingredient for a Richer Sauce:
 * ½ tsp Unflavored Powdered Gelatin
Instructions
1. Optional Step for a Richer Sauce:
If using gelatin, begin by "blooming" it. Pour 2 tablespoons of the cold vegetable broth into a small bowl. Sprinkle the ½ teaspoon of gelatin evenly over the surface. Set it aside for 5-10 minutes without stirring. The gelatin will absorb the liquid and become thick and translucent.
2. Sear the Pork:
Pat the pork pieces dry with a paper towel and season them generously with salt and pepper. Place your saucier over medium-high heat and melt the butter. Once it shimmers, add the pork in a single layer, being careful not to crowd the pot (work in batches if necessary). Sear for 2-3 minutes per side until a deep golden-brown crust forms. Transfer the seared pork to a plate and set it aside.
3. Sauté Aromatics & Deglaze:
Reduce the heat to medium. Add the minced shallot to the pot and cook in the remaining fat for 2 minutes until softened and fragrant. Add the minced garlic and thyme, stirring for another minute until aromatic. Pour in the white wine (or extra broth) to deglaze. As it bubbles, use a wooden spoon or whisk to scrape all the flavorful browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Allow the wine to reduce by about half.
4. Build the Sauce:
Whisk in the remaining vegetable broth and the heavy cream.
 * If using gelatin: Add the bloomed gelatin mixture to the pot now. Whisk continuously as the sauce heats up until the gelatin has completely dissolved.
   Whisk in the Dijon and whole grain mustards until the sauce is smooth.
5. Cook the Pasta:
Bring the sauce to a lively simmer. Add the uncooked pasta and stir well to ensure it is submerged. Reduce the heat to maintain a steady, gentle simmer. Cook uncovered for 10-15 minutes, or according to your pasta's package directions for al dente. Stir frequently to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking. The sauce will thicken beautifully as the pasta cooks.
6. Combine and Finish:
Once the pasta is tender, turn the heat to low. Stir the seared pork and any juices from the plate back into the pot. If using, add the fresh spinach or frozen peas. Stir until the spinach has just wilted or the peas are heated through (about 1-2 minutes).
7. Serve:
Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed. Serve immediately, garnished with a generous amount of fresh parsley.
