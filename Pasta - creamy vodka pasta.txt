Vodka Pasta Recipe (No-Chili Version)
A rich, creamy, and flavorful pasta dish that comes together quickly. This version omits the chili for a milder, but equally delicious, sauce.
Yields: 4-6 servings
Prep time: 10 minutes
Cook time: 25 minutes
Ingredients
  1 lb fusilli pasta (or your choice of pasta)
  40g olive oil
  75g shallots, minced (or red onions, finely diced)
  20g garlic, minced
  A strong pinch of salt
  1 can (170g) tomato paste
  100g vodka (can be substituted with water)
  350g heavy cream
  75g butter
  50-75g Parmesan cheese, grated, plus more for serving
  Fresh cracked black pepper (for serving)
Instructions
  Boil Water: Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil for the pasta.
  Saut√© Aromatics: While the water heats, warm the olive oil in a separate large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the minced shallots, minced garlic, and a strong pinch of salt. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the shallots and garlic are soft and translucent.
  Cook Tomato Paste: Add the entire can of tomato paste to the pot. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until it darkens to a rusty color.
  Deglaze: Pour in the vodka to deglaze the pot. Let it simmer for 30 seconds, using your spoon to scrape up any flavorful bits stuck to the bottom.
  Add Cream: Stir in the heavy cream. Lower the heat and bring the sauce to a gentle simmer.
  Cook Pasta: Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package directions until al dente.
  Reserve Water & Drain: About one minute before the pasta is finished cooking, scoop out and reserve about a cup of the starchy pasta water. Then, drain the pasta.
  Combine: Add the drained pasta directly into the pot with the simmering sauce.
  Finish the Sauce: Add the butter and the grated Parmesan cheese. Stir everything together off the heat until the butter is fully melted and the sauce clings beautifully to every noodle.
  Adjust Consistency & Seasoning: If the sauce seems too thick, add a small splash of the reserved pasta water to thin it to your desired consistency. Taste and add more salt if needed.
  Serve: Plate the pasta immediately, topping it with an extra sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and a few cracks of fresh black pepper.
